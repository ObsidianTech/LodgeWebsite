                Arizona Child Identification Program addresses the alarming fact that over 1,000,000 children are reported missing in the United States each year, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). On average, a child is reported missing every 43 seconds.
                At the CHIP events, the Masons of Epes Randolph provide the equipment, volunteers and materials necessary to identifying your child in "completed packs" (not kits to be filled out by you at home) for you to take home for safe keeping. In the event your child is missing, you then provide the AZCHIP package to law enforcement as an aid in recovery and identification.
                No information nor data is retained by anyone involved with the CHIP program. Only the permission slip is retained to document the number of children served. No copies of any ID materials are kept on file by any of the organizations.
                Epes Randolph Lodge, part of the Arizona Freemasons, is proud to bring the families of our state this wonderful program for the protection of all our children.

        <p>Arizona Child Identification Program addresses the alarming fact that more children are reported missing each year. While most are found, many are not. All of the identification materials generated by the program are given to the child's family. We retain none of the information offered by this program. This CHIP program is offered to the public at NO CHARGE.</p>
