            <h3>History</h3>
            <p align="justify"><b>The Man:</b> Epes Randolph was born on August 16, 1856 in Lunenburg County, VA. 
            He was a notable civil engineer of his time, constructing railroads and spearheading an effort to restore the Colorado River to its banks. 
            He oversaw the construction of monuments like the C&O Railroad Bridge and eventually wound up as President of the 
            Los Angeles Railway, Southern Pacific Railroad of Mexico, Arizona Eastern Railway and more. He served on the University of Arizona Board of Regents,
            and was a prominent member of the Elks and an honorary 33rd Degree Scottish Rite Mason. He passed away on August 22, 1921, just after turning 65.

            <p align="justify"><b>The Lodge:</b> Our Lodge was the second Masonic Lodge organized in Tucson, Arizona. Its charter is dated February 14, 1923. 
            This Lodge and its members played an important rile in the early history of Tucson, with many early city pioneers and leaders serving as 
            Master of the Lodge or in other leadership roles.Over the years, the Lodge has flourished and Marion McDaniel Lodge building,
            located at 3959 E Mabel Street, became our home. Current Lodge membership is nearly 250 individuals and the Lodge is very active in social, educational, and philanthropic programs. 
            Notably, out Child ID program is one of the few active ones for Lodges in the whole state!
            <p>

            as well as current information on our activities and a monthly calendar of events.
